# discord-token-grabber
This small program will just get you your discord token

# Features
 - No local caching
 - Does not use webhooks (doesn't send your token to anyone)
 - Searches for authorization tokens in multiple directories (Discord, Discord PTB, Discord Canary, Google chrome, Opera, Brave and Yandex)
 - Does not require [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


You can either install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the script or use the [compiled exe](https://github.com/Jekabs123/discord-token-grabber/releases). Both work the same.
